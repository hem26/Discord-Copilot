Okay, I understand you want a clear explanation of *why* you are getting the `Invalid supabaseUrl` error, even if you believe your URL is correct.

Here's the reason:

1.  **Where the error comes from:** The error `Invalid supabaseUrl: Must be a valid HTTP or HTTPS URL.` is generated by the `@supabase/supabase-js` library itself. This library is used in your bot's `index.js` file on this line:
    ```javascript
    const supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY);
    ```
    The `createClient` function expects a valid web address (URL) as its first argument (`SUPABASE_URL`).

2.  **The Mismatch:**
    *   In your `index.js` file, the bot is trying to read the Supabase URL from `process.env.SUPABASE_URL`.
    *   However, the `.env` file you showed me has the variable named `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`.

3.  **Why this causes the error:**
    *   The `dotenv` library (which reads your `.env` file) is very strict about variable names. When your bot starts, it looks for an environment variable *exactly* named `SUPABASE_URL`.
    *   Because your `.env` file contains `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` instead, `process.env.SUPABASE_URL` ends up being `undefined` (meaning, "not found").
    *   When `createClient` receives `undefined` as its `supabaseUrl` parameter, it correctly identifies `undefined` as *not* a valid HTTP or HTTPS URL, and thus throws the `Invalid supabaseUrl` error.

**In simpler terms:** Your bot is looking for a key labeled "SUPABASE_URL" in your environment, but you've provided a key labeled "NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL". It's like having a locker labeled "A" and looking for something in "B" – you won't find it, even if "B" contains what you need.

**The Solution (again, as this is the root cause for *this specific error*):**
You *must* change the variable name in your `.env` file from `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` to `SUPABASE_URL`.

After fixing this, remember that your `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` and `DISCORD_TOKEN` might also be incomplete based on your previous `.env` content. These will cause different errors later if not fully corrected.
